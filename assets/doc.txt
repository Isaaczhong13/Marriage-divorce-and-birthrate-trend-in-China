
Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen rank as premier China Tier 1 Cities given their size, prominence, and importance from the 
governmental, commercial, transportation, and cultural weight each carries for China. The list below indicates each premier China Tier 1 
Cities and its municipality or province: [3]

 1. Beijing (北京, Beijing Municipality)
 2. Guangzhou (广州, Guangdong Province)
 3. Shanghai (上海, Shanghai Municipality)
 4. Shenzhen (深圳, Guangdong Province)

As of June 2021, around 62 percent of residents who lived in China's first-tier cities were single, while singles only accounted for 38.8 
percent of the total population in China's fourth-tier and below cities. Due to the young labor force inflow, residents in China's higher-
tier cities are comparably younger. [4]

With the decline in marriage rates and the increase in divorce rates in China, the number of single people is gradually increasing. 
According to statistics from the Civil Affairs Bureau in March, since 2014, the number of marriage registrations in China has been 
decreasing for seven consecutive years.

Such data actually shows that the number of people getting married and having children is decreasing, while the number of single 
people is increasing. Currently, the single rate in major cities in China has reached 50%, and the situation is even more serious in first-
tier cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. In Shenzhen, the single rate has reached 77.23%.

Interestingly, even though there are more men staying single in China, more female population stay single in tier-one cities. This trend is even 
more obvious for partner-seekers who are aged above 30.

Why are more young individuals opting for solitude? Various factors play a role, including economic stability, social connections, looks, and 
personality. Interestingly, partner preferences differ among singles based on their location and status. Mr. Li, burdened by the 996 work 
schedule, craves rest after work and admits to having a limited social circle with no time for dating. Ms. Zhao, who owns a house and car, is 
focused on saving for retirement. She seeks a partner with good looks and character, especially given the uncertainties surrounding 
marriage. Ms. Zhou places a high value on family time and believes that if there's a mismatch in profession or background with a potential 
partner, she'd rather remain single. Mr. Wang opines that quality solitude is far superior to mediocre love, emphasizing that self-care is of 
utmost importance. With the economic growth, there's been a noticeable shift in the perspectives of singles. They've moved away from 
the traditional mindset of "raising kids for old age" and are now more inclined towards personal savings and insurance for future security. 
For many, the mantra is clear: be self-reliant, support aging parents, and let marriage unfold naturally. [5]

Research data shows that approximately 54.1% of respondents cannot accept getting married while
renting a house, which is significantly higher than the proportion that can accept it. According to the
"2020 Marriage Housing Consumption Survey Report", the proportions of the two groups are almost
equal. Due to differences in the research samples, the data does not necessarily indicate that the
proportion of those who reject marriage while renting is on the rise. However, it can be concluded that
the majority of people reject the idea of getting married while renting.

From a gender perspective, there is a clear difference between men and women in their acceptance of
getting married while renting. 57.97% of male respondents said they would accept it, while only about
38.71% of female respondents said the same. The traditional concept of "having a house before
marriage" has a greater impact on women, and owning a house has become one of the most important
criteria for choosing a spouse among women. Of course, in first-tier cities and some new first-tier cities
where housing prices are relatively high, owning a house is also the primary symbol for men to
demonstrate their financial strength.

Tier three and below cities are generally cheaper compared with top tier cities, so there is a significant
drop in single population. [5]
